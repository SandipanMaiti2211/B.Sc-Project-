# B.Sc-Project- Statistical Introspection of Feeding Trial of Livestocks in India
For my B.Sc course curriculum, I have made a project on a real-life statistical problem of feeding trials of the livestock in India under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sudhansu S. Maiti (Visva-Bharati) and Prof. Subhadip Banerjee (RKMRC Narendrapur). Here I have provided the abstract of my project.

Livestock systems have both positive and negative effects on the natural resource base, public health, social equity, and economic growth. In India, because of various reasons and changing Agro-climatic conditions, the hair type of the majority of Sheep is coarse and carpet type. So, the production of fine wool is very limited. But proper Feeding, Housing, Health care, Handling, and Harvesting can produce high-quality wool. If we apply a very accurate ratio of elements of FEED in the diet of wool-producing sheep then can get more wool yield and good quality of wool also. Our main objective is to find any possible association between the FEEDs and YIELD are there or not. We should try to find out the best feeding trial for better yields.

I would highly recommend people to reach out regarding the extension works of this paper. I guess through further inspection of livestock farming and their feeding trials, we can even come up with a better regression formula regarding different factors in this industry to have even better production.
